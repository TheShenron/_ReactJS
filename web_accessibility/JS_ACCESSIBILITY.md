# Accessibility Best Practices for Web Development

This guide outlines key accessibility best practices to make your web applications inclusive and usable by everyone.

---

## Semantic Structure (HTML)
- Use semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, etc.) to provide meaningful structure.
- Avoid using `<div>` and `<span>` for elements that can be described with semantic tags.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <header>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
  ```

---

## Labels and Forms
- Associate inputs with `<label>` using the `for` attribute, or use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.
- Add additional hints using `aria-describedby`.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" required aria-describedby="emailHelp">
  <p id="emailHelp">We'll never share your email.</p>
  ```

---

## Keyboard Navigation
- Ensure all interactive elements (links, buttons, form fields) are keyboard-operable.
- Use `tabindex` to manage focus order (`0` for focusable elements, `-1` for programmatic focus).
- Avoid using non-semantic elements like `<div>` for buttons unless ARIA attributes are added.

---

## Alternative Text for Images
- Use `alt` attributes for all meaningful images. Use `alt=""` for decorative images.
- **Example**:  
  ```html
  <img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
  ```

---

## Color and Contrast
- Ensure text-background contrast meets WCAG guidelines:
  - 4.5:1 for normal text.
  - 3:1 for large text.
- Use tools like the WebAIM Contrast Checker.

---

## Focus Management
- Provide visible focus indicators using CSS:
  ```css
  button:focus-visible {
    outline: 2px solid blue;
  }
  ```
- Programmatically manage focus for modals, dialogs, and other dynamic content.

---

## Skip Links
- Include "Skip to content" links for keyboard users.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>
  ```

---

## Dynamic Content Updates
- Announce updates with ARIA live regions:
  ```html
  <div aria-live="polite" id="notification">No new notifications.</div>
  ```

---

## Responsive Design and Text Scaling
- Use relative units (`em`, `rem`) for scalable and responsive text.
- Ensure clickable targets are at least 48x48 pixels.

---

## Multimedia Accessibility
- Provide captions or subtitles for audio and video using `<track>`.
- Respect user motion preferences with `prefers-reduced-motion`.

---

## ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)
- Use ARIA roles and states (`role="button"`, `aria-expanded`) for custom widgets.
- **Example**:
  ```html
  <button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="menu">Menu</button>
  ```

---

## Testing and Auditing
- Use tools like:
  - [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
  - [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/)
  - [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/)
- Test manually with screen readers such as NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver.

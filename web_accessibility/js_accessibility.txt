<form>
<lable for='phone'>phone</lable>
<input  id='phone'/>
</form>


Note:screen mirror

others ways to lable the inputs
and these lable working by there prioroty (see in browser)

1.Arial-lable
<input arial-label='phone' />


Note: In browser we are having call accessbility tree view
ctrl + shift + p
search for accessbility and enable it


2.Arial-labelBy
<input arial-labelby='phone' />

3.Placeholder
<input placeholder='phone' />

4.Arial-live
<input arial-live='polite' />
off
asswrtive
it has three different options


Note:Chrome color dev tool
accessbility tree view -> Rendring -> we can text for blur, low cotrast and othre screens view
another one is color contrast ratio -> chrome has inbuilt option in color picker

Note: We shold use all symentic element and one page should has one h1 teg (h1 tegs are not for insreasing the font size)

Note: Click event need to use with button only not for div

Note: use of ancre teg (<a/>) with the help of tab we can highlite and should have meaningful text not only click me

Note: Super import to use screen reader to text our app

5.Tabindex
<div tabindex='0' />
either 0 or negative otherise it wii focuse first on that element
negative value we can only focus by JS code not by the user tab,
if some div has scroll there we can user tabindex as 0 so that user can focus and scroll on it.
but we need to use arial-lable as well to help screeen reader or maybe browser


important
we can remove the default tab focus border by
button{outline:'none'}
but whenever we are removing any default tag behavior then need to add by css
button:focus-visible{
    border:'1px solid red'
}


important6
Skipline
when user will come to the web page for see the content and press tab need to able the skip and reach to the main content

Important 
if we are using vidoe or audio we need to use capiton


Note: proper spacing and padding so that we can easily clikc on the buttons and need to attach lable it possible


important
Need to leand about preferew-reduse-motion (html-css)

Note: Autofocus for inputbox


important: Dont forget to test webpage with chrome lighthouse (general test)

Note:Need to explore chrome Accessbility thengs
